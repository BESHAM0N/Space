Welcome to Elemental Arena, where you become the mastermind behind the world's most spectacular circus! In this cards-strategy game, you'll assemble breathtaking performances by combining elemental acts and triggering incredible chain reactions.

*Check out the table of element interactions on the left side of the screen. 

The first element in the reaction is the vertical element, the second element of the reaction is the horizontal element. 

Compare the card elements with the table elements and choose the best combination option. 

!Remember that the whole bundle starts from left to right!
